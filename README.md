# feature-discussions

This is our public repository for discussing new features.

You can view them as a kanban board on the organization's [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/LeanAdmin/projects/1) project.

If you have any feature suggestions, definitely feel free to open an issue. One thing we ask is that you make them well-formulated, with a good description of what exactly this feature would do and why you think it's useful.

Also, some features might eventually be added to separate packages, to keep the core *lean*er and have a good separation of the admin panel and additional features.
